# Bank-Project
We developed this simulation of a bank using the web development skills we acquired over the past month. Although it does not have a backend, user credentials are hardcoded. My brother and I worked on this project together, and it was a valuable learning experience for us as we were able to apply and expand upon our web development skills. Through this project, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of the various technologies and techniques involved in web development.
